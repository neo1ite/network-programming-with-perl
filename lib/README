These are various pure-Perl modules developed for the book "Network
Programming with Perl", by Lincoln Stein.  Many of the example scripts
from the book are dependent on one or more of these modules.

You can install them in one of two ways:

1) On systems that have the make or nmake utilities installed, make
the directory that contains this README file current and type:

	% perl Makefile.PL
	% make
	% make install

Notice that there is no "make test".

2) On systems that do not have either of these utilities (such as
unenhanced Windows and Macintosh systems), I have provided a small
script named "install.pl" that will copy these modules into the
appropriate location for site-specific libraries on your system.

Make the directory that contains this README file current and type:

	C:> perl install.pl

Macintosh users should run the script from within MacPerl.

You will see messages indicating that the files are being copied to
their destinations.  If you wish to install the modules into an
alternative location, you may provide the target directory as an
argument:

	C:> perl install.pl C:\temporary\perllib

After this, you will have to set the PERL5LIB environment variable
appropriately so that the example scripts can find these modules.

Have fun!
