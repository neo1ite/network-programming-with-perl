The example scripts contained in this directory have been processed to
be portable to machines that have the Perl interpreter located in
different places.

To install the scripts, run the "install.pl" script located in the
current directory.  The scripts will be extracted and (hopefully)
correctly localized for your system, then copied into the directory
designated as the "site scripts directory" when you installed Perl.

To install into an alternative location, pass install.pl the directory
of the location you wish to place the scripts.  For example:

  % install.pl /usr/local/tmp/stein_book_examples

Have fun!
