SOURCE CODE FOR NETWORK PROGRAMMING WITH PERL

The directories named "ch1", "ch2" and so on contain the source code
for the example scripts and modules developed in the corresponding
chapter.  In cases where the same module has been used in multiple
chapters, I have created a symbolic link from the current directory to
the earliest chapter directory in which the module is used.

The "lib" directory contains the consolidated example modules
organized hierarchically by name.  If you wish to install all the
modules at once, simply enter this directory and follow the directions
in the README file there.  Please be aware that only the modules
developed specifically for the "Network Programming with Perl" book
are present here.  Third party networking modules, such as
Net::Telnet, must be installed from CPAN, http://www.cpan.org/

Similarly, the "scripts" directory contains all the example scripts in
a single directory.  They have been preprocessed in order to make them
portable to your system.  To install them, enter the directory and
follow the directions in the README file.

I have made every attempt to keep these scripts safe and bug-free, but
everyone is human.  Be very careful before you install these scripts
on a production system, or on a system that is open to the world.  In
particular, don't leave any of the example servers running long-term
without monitoring what they're doing and who is using them.  Remember
that these scripts are intended as learning examples and not as
production software.

Enjoy!
